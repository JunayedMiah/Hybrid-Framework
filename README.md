The hybrid framework combining Kernel PCA and Spectral Clustering offers powerful tools for nonlinear data segmentation, capturing complex patterns and improving clustering accuracy. However, it also presents challenges in terms of computational cost, parameter tuning, and interpretability. Awareness of these limitations helps in effectively applying this framework to various data segmentation tasks.
